# Calculator for American Sign Language Arithmetic

Project C.A.S.L.A (Calculator for American Sign Language Arithmetic) 
seeks to create a glove for ASL users to seamlessly translate
physically signed arithmetic into readable text using Parallax’s Basic
Stamp 2 (BS2) and other relevant electronic components. The design
consists of 5 flex sensors attached to each digit of a glove to detect
the bend of each finger. The resistance generated from the flex sensors 
when the gloved hands sign numbers acts as an analog input,
which can be read for further ASL interpretation. Four buttons, one
for addition, subtraction, next digit, and equality, acts to capture the
current desired arithmetic operation. An accompanying LCD display keeps 
track of the arithmetic operation (and displays results)
for user monitoring. When calibrated to a user’s hand, C.A.S.L.A
showcases the ability to detect all 10 ASL numbers and sequentially
conduct calculations (akin to a hand-held calculator). This project
will benefit the ASL community as it allows ASL users to interact
with those who are not fluent in ASL in a mathematical context, and
vice versa. When conducting conversations that utilize mathematical
components and arguments, not every individual might have access
to a pen and paper at hand, and not every American-English Speaker
understands the numerical ASL hand signs. Utilizing C.A.S.L.A can
enable more fluent conversation in mathematics between the hearing
and deaf communities.

# Hardware and Software Requirements
Requires a Parallax's Basic Stamp 2 Microcontroller, and knowledge in the PBASIC 2.5 Programming Language.
See "CASLA Documentation.pdf" for more details on construction, electronics, circuit diagrams, etc.
